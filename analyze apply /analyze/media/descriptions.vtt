Responsive design provides an optimum viewing experience for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
Begin by creating a wireframe for each viewport.
Larger viewports allow for multiple columns of content.
Use a single column layout for mobile viewports.
When the wireframes are complete, you can begin the webpage development.
